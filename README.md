Where to play your game (a link to your deployed game) 

How all of your data assets (if you have any) were created: all assets were created on Piskel.com. I drew all of pixelart by hand. 

experience requirements below:
-The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player : Two players (or one loney player) controls two characters through movement and jumping and interacting with buttons and doors to play through the game. 

-The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact): Player(s) need to walk both of the character to the door to proceed to the next level.

-3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scene: 3 levels with transitions and ending scene.
